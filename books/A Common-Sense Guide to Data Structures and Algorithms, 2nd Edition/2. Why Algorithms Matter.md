# Chapter 2. Why Algorithms Matter

- *algorithm*: a set of instruction given to a computer to achieve a particular task

## Ordered Arrays

  | Operations | Best | Worst |
  | :--------: | :--: | :---: |
  | Insertion | N + 1 | N + 2 |

- the number of steps for insertion remains similar no matter where in the ordered array a new value ends up

## Searching an Ordered Array

  | Algorithm | Best | Worst |
  | :--------: | :--: | :---: |
  | Linear Search | 1 | N |
  | Binary Search | log N | log N |

- ⭐ each time we double the data, the binary search algorithm adds just one more stop
- ⭐ by using an ordered array, you have somewhat slower insertion, but much faster search
- ⭐ using binary search makes insertion become faster as well
  - because insertion requires a search before the actual insertion
